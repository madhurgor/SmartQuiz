# Icon Files for SmartQuiz Chrome Extension

This directory should contain the following icon files:

## Required Icons:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels) - Small icon for extension toolbar

- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) - Large icon for extension management
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Store icon

## Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use a brain or quiz-related symbol
- Colors should match the extension theme (#667eea, #764ba2)
- Simple, clean design that's recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using: üß†, üéØ, ‚ùì, or a combination

## Creating Icons:
You can create these icons using:
- Canva
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- Any graphic design tool

## Temporary Solution:
For development/testing, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use online icon generators
3. Convert emoji to PNG format

The extension will work without icons but they're recommended for a professional appearance.
